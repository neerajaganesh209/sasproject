# sasproject
Implement a menu-driven console application that supports: 
- Adding tasks (title, description, due date)
- Listing tasks (all, only completed, or only pending)
- Updating existing tasks - Marking tasks as completed
- Deleting tasks
- Store tasks in memory using Java collections (List / Map) - Map is used here
- Persist tasks between runs by saving them to a file (e.g., CSV or simple text format). - Jackson is used here with file stored in JSON file which can be stored in DBs in future.
- Load tasks from the file on application startup.
- Provide clear console output for all operations.
